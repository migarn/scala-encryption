Encryption is a console application which enables both encrypting and decrypting given text by means of two ciphers: Caesar cipher and Vigen√®re cipher. The appliation enables a use of three different alphabets and also gives a possibility to maintain or reject spaces, punctuation and symbols which do not belong to the chosen alphabet.
